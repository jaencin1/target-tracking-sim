# ðŸŽ¯ Target Tracking Simulation System

This C++ project simulates a real time target tracking system using a Kalman Filter. Built with defense and aerospace use cases in mind, it emulates sensor noise, prediction models, and system timing mimicking real world radar tracking.

## Features
- Simulated object motion
- Kalman filter for noisy data correction
- Real-time prediction loop
- Modular and expandable design

## Technologies
- C++
- Visual Studio code

## Why This Matters
This project was inspired by real-world tracking systems used in aerospace and defense. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in algorithmic thinking, simulation modeling, and low-level system design using C++.


# developer notes
You're simulating a moving target (like an aircraft or missile), and a tracker (like a radar or sensor system) trying to estimate the position of that target over time, even when the tracker only gets noisy or partial data.

This mimics what Raytheon systems might do in real-world defense or aerospace situations.
